# WeatherDashboard
Using the OpenWeather API, this application allows users to search for weather forecasts in their city.

## Description
The purpose of this application is to provide a traveller with access to weather information in any city. Not only does the application save the user's searches for ease of revisting while travel planning, but the application also displays a five-day projected forecast. A traveller can therefore use just one application to see the weather in their current location and plan accordingly for their next destination. Building this application was really beneficial for complex styling skills using Bootstrap and complex functionality as I develop better Javascript/jQuery knowlege. Going beyond the skills I've developed in the (virtual) classroom, this project challenged my ability to call APIs and manipulate data from multiple Open Weather calls. In addition, the local storage aspect was very important to display in this application and therefore was also a major focus of the code here.
